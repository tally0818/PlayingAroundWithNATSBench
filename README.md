üß† Exploring Neural Architecture Search with NATS-Bench

This Jupyter Notebook demonstrates a hands-on exploration of Neural Architecture Search (NAS) using the NATS-Bench benchmark.

It walks through three major areas:

  Environment Setup & Dataset Preparation

  Multi-Trial NAS Algorithms

-Zero-Cost Proxies

üîÅ 1. Multi-Trial NAS Algorithms

This section covers classic multi-trial NAS methods:

  Random Search

  Regularized Evolution (EA)

  Reinforcement Learning-based Search

Key analyses include:

  Accuracy & loss visualization across different strategies.

  Comparison of algorithm performance on NATS-Bench.

  Insights into why regularized evolution tends to outperform others.
---
‚ö° 2. Zero-Cost NAS Proxies

This part introduces:

  Fast performance prediction techniques without full training.

  Initial experiments and interpretations of zero-cost proxy effectiveness.
